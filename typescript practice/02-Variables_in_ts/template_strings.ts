// this is very similar to js template string with the help of this we can just simply embade a variable string inside a string

let firstName : string = "Arunava";
let lastName : string = "Ghosh";
var marks = 87.33;
var result = "Promoted";

console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName} has obtained ${marks} and he has ${result}`);
