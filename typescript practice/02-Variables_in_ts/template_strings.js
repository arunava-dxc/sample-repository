// this is very similar to js template string with the help of this we can just simply embade a variable string inside a string
var firstName = "Arunava";
var lastName = "Ghosh";
var marks = 87.33;
var result = "Promoted";
console.log("".concat(firstName, " ").concat(lastName, " has obtained ").concat(marks, " and he has ").concat(result));
